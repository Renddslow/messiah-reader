Messiah means anointed or chosen. As we look for the Messiah in promises and genealogies of Scripture we start to realize that we need someone from among the humans that is specifically _chosen_ to be the seed of the woman. Someone who is _anointed_ to be the Messiah.

That's why its so fitting that the New Testament should begin with a genealogy. The Gospel of Matthew knows what it's doing. It's not just a list of names. It's a list of names that point to the Messiah. It's a list of names that point to Jesus.

God does something really unique here. He doesn't just single out one human from among the many as he did with Abraham. He unites himself with human flesh. The Second Person of the Trinity joins himself to human flesh, becoming both God and man in one package. This is the mystery of the incarnation, the promise we've been waiting for since the garden.
