## Acts 1:6–11

{1.6} So when they had come together, they began asking him, saying, “Lord, is it at this time you are restoring the kingdom to Israel?” {1.7} But he said to them, “It is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has set by his own authority. {1.8} But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the farthest part of the earth.” {1.9} And after he had said these things, while they were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their sight. {1.10} And as they were staring into the sky while he was departing, behold, two men in white clothing stood by them {1.11} who also said, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand there looking into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into heaven like this will come back in the same way you saw him departing into heaven!”

## Acts 7:55–60

{7.55} But Stephen, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked intently into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. {7.56} And he said, “Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!” {7.57} But crying out with a loud voice, they stopped their ears and rushed at him with one purpose. {7.58} And after they had driven him out of the city, they began to stone him, and the witnesses laid aside their cloaks at the feet of a young man named Saul. {7.59} And they kept on stoning Stephen as he was calling out and saying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!” {7.60} And falling to his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, do not hold this sin against them!” And after he said this, he fell asleep.
