## Isaiah 53

> {53.1} Who has believed our message,
>> and to whom has the arm of Yahweh been revealed?
> {53.2} For he went up like a shoot before him,
>> and like a root from dry ground.
> He had no form and no majesty that we should see him,
>> and no appearance that we should take pleasure in him.
> {53.3} He was despised and rejected by men,
>> a man of suffering, and acquainted with sickness,
> and like one from whom others hide their faces, he was despised,
>> and we did not hold him in high regard.
> {53.4} However, he was the one who lifted up our sicknesses,
>> and he carried our pain,
>> yet we ourselves assumed him stricken,
>> struck down by God and afflicted.
> {53.5} But he was pierced because of our transgressions,
>> crushed because of our iniquities;
> the chastisement for our peace was upon him,
>> and by his wounds we were healed.
> {53.6} All of us have wandered about like sheep;
>> we each have turned to his own way;
> and Yahweh let fall on him
>> the iniquity of us all.
> {53.7} He was oppressed and afflicted,
>> yet he did not open his mouth;
> he was brought like a lamb to the slaughter,
>> and like a sheep is dumb before its shearers,
>> so he did not open his mouth.
> {53.8} He was taken by restraint of justice,
>> and who concerned himself with his generation?
> For he was cut off from the land of the living;
>> he received a blow because of the transgression of my people.
> {53.9} He made his grave with the wicked,
>> and with the rich in his death,
> although he had done no violence,
>> and there was no deceit in his mouth.
> {53.10} Yet Yahweh was pleased to crush him;
>> he made him sick.
> If she places his life a guilt offering,
>> he will see offspring.
> He will prolong days,
>> and the will of Yahweh will succeed in his hand.
> {53.11} From the trouble of his life he will see;
>> he will be satisfied.
> In his knowledge, the righteous one, my servant, shall declare many righteous,
>> and he is the one who will bear their iniquities.
> {53.12} Therefore, I will divide to him a portion among the many,
>> and with the strong ones he will divide bounty,
>> because he poured his life out to death
> and was counted with the transgressors;
>> and he was the one who bore the sin of many
>> and will intercede for the transgressors.
