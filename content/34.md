In the second half of the book of Isaiah, we're introduced to an enigmatic figure: the Servant. In Isaiah 60-62, the Servant takes on a the role of a victorious and triumphant figure. The Servant is described as the one who will bring salvation and deliverance to the people of Israel, and who will reign as king over a new and glorious kingdom. The Servant will be anointed by YHWH and proclaim a year of jubilee.

But all of this is framed through the lens of the Servant's suffering at the hands of Israel in Isaiah 53. This, and the Job passages that we'll meditate on, help us to expect a figure who is righteous, blameless, and innocent, but who will nevertheless suffer.
