## The Exalted King

We concluded the Solomon story seeing a king who was wealthy and exalted among the nations, but he ultimately failed the test. He tried to make a name for himself and nearly destroyed a people because of it.

But when we get to the New Testament we encounter Jesus. We are told that he is God's anointed king, the heir that Yahweh spoke to David about in 2 Samuel 7. All throughout the book of Mark, we're expecting him to go into a palace, put on a royal robe, command the worship of his army, receive his crown, and then be enthroned above the nation.

And that is exactly what happens. But it happens a little differently than we'd expect. Mark portrays Jesus' crucifixion as his enthronement. His moment of greatest weakness _is_ his exaltation.
