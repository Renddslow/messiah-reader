title: Jesus Among the Beasts
id: 51
---

Where the humans consistently failed the test and were ruled by their beastly urges instead of ruling over them, Jesus was different. In Matthew, Mark, and Luke Jesus is depicted as going into the desert—the land of the chaos-serpent-beast—to be tested. In his test, he is tempted to eat good-looking food and rely on his own wisdom. But the words of the _Torah_, specifically Deuteronomy, are constantly in Jesus' mouth.

What makes this story so interesting is a very particular phrase that Mark uses to describe Jesus' temptation which sets it apart from the other Gospel narratives: "And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him."

Both testing narratives conclude with Jesus proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. A new world is being inaugurated with a new king fit to rule.
