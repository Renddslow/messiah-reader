## Matthew 4:1–17

{4.1} Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil, {4.2} and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he was hungry. {4.3} And the tempter approached and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order that these stones become bread.” {4.4} But he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.”

{4.5} Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the highest point of the temple {4.6} and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down! For it is written,

> ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’

and

> ‘On their hands they will lift you up,
>> lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”

{4.7} Jesus said to him, “On the other hand it is written, ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’”

{4.8} Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory, {4.9} and he said to him, “I will give to you all these things, if you will fall down and worship me.” {4.10} Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’” {4.11} Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began ministering to him.

{4.12} Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. {4.13} And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali, {4.14} in order that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,

> {4.15} “Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,
>> toward the sea, on the other side of the Jordan,
>> Galilee of the Gentiles—
> {4.16} the people who sit in darkness
>> have seen a great light,
> and the ones who sit in the land and shadow of death,
>> a light has dawned on them.”

{4.17} From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near.”
