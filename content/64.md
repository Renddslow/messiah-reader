We exist in an already-but-not-yet phase of human history. Jesus Messiah has inaugurated his kingdom, but we are still awaiting its final consummation. We might say that Jesus has already successfully stormed the beaches of Normandy in a cosmic D-Day, but we are still waiting for the final victory parade in VE-day.

As we wait, we are called to live in this tension. To live and work as if Christ's kingdom is here now, but to also honestly evaluate the world as it is and say with the Psalmist and the writer of Lamentations, "How long, O Lord?"

We come to the end of our journey, knowing that to believe the Jesus is Lord is the ultimate claim to his authority and sovereignty.

And so we proclaim with the Apostle Paul, "Maranatha!" Come, Lord Jesus! And remind ourselves of that old hymn, "Christ has died, Christ is risen, Christ will come again." May he hasten.
