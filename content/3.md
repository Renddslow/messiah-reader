Did you catch that? Right in the middle of the Fall narrative God tells the serpent that he will now have a hostile relationship with the woman, and that eventually, the **seed of the woman** will crush his head (Genesis 3:15).

This is a huge deal. So huge in fact that theologians gave this verse a huge word: _proto-euangelion_ or "first gospel."

What we discover is that the Bible from its earliest pages has been telling a story about the Messiah. But we as readers don't quite know who he is yet. What we do know is that he will be a descendant of the woman. This means two things. First, any time we see the birth of a son, we should pay attention. Second, anytime we reach a genealogy, we should pay attention.

Genealogies aren't lists of names for historical record-keeping like ancient Ancestry.com. Genealogies are written to make a point. They are meant to bring our minds back to the promise of Genesis 3:15. One day, one of the names on this list is going to be the Messiah. The one who restores the heaven and earth relationship and brings his people rest.
