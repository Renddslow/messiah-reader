The next priest we meet in the Biblical story is a man named Melchizedek. He's a peculiar figure. His name literally translates as "King of Righteousness" and he hails from the city of Jerusalem, the city which would become King David's royal seat.

Melchizedek meets Abraham after a battle against raiding Canaanite kings. Out of nowhere, Melchizedek emerges bearing the fruits of Eden. He provides Abraham with bread and wine. Then he blesses him.

Following this story, we see that this blessing is confirmed by YHWH, who extends the blessing he had given to Abraham in chapter 12. This is exactly what the Eden priests were meant to do. Provide, caretake, and extend the blessing of God to the whole world.

All of these things happen on a very special mountain: Zion. This would be the same mountain that Solomon would eventually build the Temple. It is also on this mountain that just a few chapters later, Abraham would attempt to sacrifice his son (22:14).
