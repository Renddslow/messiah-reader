Alone on the cross, Jesus cries out in the words of Psalm 22. In the past, many have assumed that this meant that God had actually abandoned him. This is a troubling premise though, if for no other reason that it messes with some pretty important Trinitarian categories.

Instead, what Jesus is doing here is not making a claim about God's presence, but uploading the entirety of Psalm 22 into his hearers' minds. The claim was not that God was absent, but that dominion belongs to YHWH, and that Jesus would be vindicated in spite of his suffering.
