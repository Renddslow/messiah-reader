Two of Jesus' disciples were hoping for places of extreme honor when Jesus' kingdom was fulfilled. While we have to be careful assuming their headspace, we can assume that they expected the kingdom to be initiated with physical violence against the empire and a complete overturning. 

It seems like such a natural question. Yet Jesus is clear that his disciples have missed the point of the Messiah entirely. Yes there would be an overturning, but much like the climax of Jonah, it would be an overturning of hearts. What his disciples didn't understand was that the way to victory was through suffering.

The Son of Man story seems to come to a close with Jesus' death. The beastly impulses of humans are judged and cast down as they seem to overwhelm Jesus to the point of his death. But in the resurrection, their power is broken. The ultimate weapon of evil—death—has no power when resurrection is on the table.

In real time we watch in Acts 1 as the Daniel 7 prophecy is fulfilled. Jesus literally ascends on a cloud, and as the first martyr is killed in witness to Jesus, we see the Messiah has indeed been sat at the Father's right hand.

We too are vindicated with Messiah in our deaths.
