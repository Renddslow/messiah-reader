title: "Beastly Ruler"

In the book of Daniel we are introduced to a colorful cast of characters: four Jewish heroes who are part of Israel's noble class, having been deported from Jerusalem to Babylon during the first wave of Babylonian exile, and a series of despotic kings. These kings, though they often appear to be bumbling their way through the stories, are underpinned by a repeated motif: being a beast.

Just like Cain, the kings of Babylon are given the choice to choose the good, but consistently they choose their own power, ego, and wealth. They become like beasts, the very creatures they were designed to rule over. One king even physically transforms into a beast, grazing on the grass like cattle.

But Daniel is different. He chooses the good, not eating tempting food and receiving wisdom directly from YHWH.
