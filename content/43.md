In Genesis 1–2, humans are given the unique vocation of ruling and caring for all the living creatures—or beasts. But very quickly, we see the humans surrendering this vocation as they listen to the words of a crafty _beast_ — a chaos-serpent-beast (Genesis 3).

But despite this, God doesn't lose hope in the humans. While they are exiled from the garden and lose access to his life-giving presence, they are still invited to rule over the beasts. In Genesis 4, the first human child is filled with a beastly urge to destroy his brother. When God fronts him, he describes this sinful urge as a beast, a creature which Cain can rule over by choosing the good.

Cain fails. He surrenders his authority over to the beastly urges of sin and death. And as a result, humanity is catapulted into a world of violence and death which will lead to the great empire of Babylon.
