## A Godly King

At the end of the Creation narrative God assigns humans to the vocation of kings and queens over the earth. They're kingdom stretched from the domain of the birds, to the kingdoms of the sea, to the lands of the creatures of the fields.

The humans were royal priests.

But as we well know by this point, they rebelled and gave up their authority.

But God promised that a **seed of the woman** would come and crush the head of the serpent. This seed would be a priest-king who would rule over the earth as his ancestors had failed to do.

What this fundamentally means is that God is not weird about kings and queens. We are. We often think that a king means tyranny and oppression. But God had a design for what a holy monarchy could look like, which he outlined for the people of Israel as they were about to enter the promised land.
