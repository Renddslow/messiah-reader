As we enter into another season of reading the Scriptures, we find ourselves once again starting in the Garden of Eden. It is here that we will first find the promise of the Messiah. It is here that humans will fall into rebellion and be exiled into a world of violence and exploitation. It is here that humans will reject their vocations as image bearers and priest-kings.

But before all of that, God creates the heavens and the earth. In this natural state of being, God-space and human-space overlap, such that God and humans are in communion with one another. Humans are designed as priests in God's unique garden, mountain temple and to serve as kings and queens over the other living creatures.
 
As we look for the promise of the Messiah, we will discover that his identity will be wrapped up in the things humans lost. He will perfectly navigate the test and come out restoring not only heaven and earth, but the vocations and purposes that humans rejected.
