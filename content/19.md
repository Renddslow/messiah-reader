## Psalm 110

> {110.1} A declaration of Yahweh to my lord,
> “Sit at my right hand
>> until I make your enemies your footstool.”
> {110.2} Yahweh will send out your mighty scepter from Zion;
>> rule in the midst of your enemies.
> {110.3} Your people will volunteer in the day of your power.
>> In holy splendor, from the womb of the dawn,
>> you will have the dew of your youth.
> {110.4} Yahweh has sworn and he will not change his mind,
>> “You are a priest forever
>> according to the manner of Melchizedek.”
> {110.5} O Lord, at your right hand
>> he will shatter kings in the day of his anger.
> {110.6} He will judge among the nations;
>> he will fill them with corpses.
>> He will shatter the rulers of many countries.
> {110.7} He will drink from the stream by the road;
>> therefore he will lift up his head.
