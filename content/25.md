## The Priest-King

The kingship in Israel gets off to a rocky start. Although Israel's first king begins his ministry under the power of the Holy Spirit through a word of prophecy, his appointment is also a little bit dubious. Who really called this guy? God or the people?

By the end of his life, he's a complete tyrant and looks nothing like the king from Deuteronomy 17. There's no way this guy could be a priest-king, let alone the **seed of the woman**.

But then we get David. David's story revolves around a person who looks a whole lot like the Deuteronomy 17 king. In fact, in one of his finest moments, he dresses up like a priest and brings the Ark of Yahweh's covenant into the his royal city.

David's affection for Yahweh didn't stop there. One day David considered that it seemed wrong that he, a mortal king, would have a house of cedar while the Ark of the Covenant, the symbol of the very presence of God, was in a tent. He decided to build God a house.

God's response? David's lineage would be the royal line of the Messiah who would be the ultimate priest-king and the ultimate temple of God.
