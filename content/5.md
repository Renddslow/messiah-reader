After only a few centuries, the humans have turned more violent, more selfish, more exploitative, and more destructive. This is what happens when humans define right and wrong on their own terms.

After cleansing the whole world with a flood, God reflects that humans will continue to do evil. External change won't be enough. The human heart will have to be made new, and somehow, human flesh will have to be reunited to God.

We would hope that Noach—whose name means "rest"—would be that **seed of the woman** (remember, you read his name in a genealogy) would crush the head of the serpent, restore heaven and earth, and bring his people rest. But it was not to be. Noach to experiences a failure in a garden and the world once again cascades into violence and exploitation.

That's why, at the high point of human evil—the creation of Babylon—God chooses Abraham and issues a new promise:

> God will make Abraham a great nation; 
> His name will become great;
> Through him will come a blessing for the whole world (hint, he's talking about the seed of the woman).
