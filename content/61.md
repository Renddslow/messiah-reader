You may have heard the term "King of Kings and Lord of Lords" before. We sing that phrase at Flatland quite a bit. What you might not know is that this term doesn't originate in the Bible, talking about Jesus. Rather it was a epithet applied to kings and emperors of the Ancient Near East. It was worn most famously by Darius the Great, the king of the Persian Empire. 

The phrase "King of Kings and Lord of Lords" was used to describe Darius because he was the king of all the kings of the world. He was seen as the supreme authority, with the power to make and enforce laws throughout his vast domain.

Throughout much of the Hebrew Bible, the writers have reflected on the coming Messiah as one who would fit the model of a prophet, priest, and king all rolled into one. But as the New Testament writers reflected on their lived experience _with_ Jesus, they realized that there was a grander title that fit Jesus' role in the world: "Lord."

We'll turn to reflect on the end of the story. Jesus Messiah will come and set all things right. In Revelation 17â€“19, we'll see vivid descriptions of Jesus as the conqueror, riding a white horse and leading the armies of heaven to defeat the forces of evil.
