So all this week we've been looking for a priest. We saw the priesthood of the line of Levi fail terribly. And of course, the humans failed in the Garden of Eden. Yet we did have this one mysterious priest.

Later Biblical writers would think about him a lot. Not because he had done anything particularly great in and of himself. He had simply carried out the basic duties of a priest. He had provided, cared for, and blessed. He had done what the Eden priests were meant to do.

But in doing that, he becomes the template not just for the ultimate priest, but for the type of priest that the Messiah would be. It is the priesthood of Melchizedek that the Psalmist and the New Testament readers belief Jesus is picking up. He is the ultimate priest, the one who will provide, care for, and bless the world. He, like Melchizedek, will provide bread and wine, but they will be his own body and own blood. His sacrifice will be the ultimate day of atonement.
