YHWH chooses a special priesthood from the tribe of Levi. This priesthood is unique. In a typical theocracy, the priests become the ultimate power brokers, ruling the nation through ritual and mystery. But in YHWH's nation, the priests are servants. In fact, YHWH views the entire nation of Israel to be priests to the world.

So this special priesthood doesn't rule or even have a status all that different from their fellow Israelites. Instead, they are set apart to serve Israel so that Israel can serve the world. As a result, the Levites don't receive any land or property. YHWH is their portion.

Ultimately, this priesthood fails miserably. They are meant to proclaim God's blessing to the people, like Melchizedek did to Abraham and the humans were meant to do in the garden. But instead, they lead the people astray in the worship of other gods.

The world needs a priest who cannot fail. So as we read about the failures of the priests of Levi, consider the grace God is aiming to establish for the sake of his people but the priests fail to convey.

By the way, the first appearance of the Hebrew word "messiah" (anointed) comes in the book of Leviticus. It is used to describe the special status of these Levitical priests.
