Welcome! Throughout this sermon series we're exploring the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus through six core identities and vocations of Christ.

In this introduction we want to introduce to a few concepts that have informed the way this reader will work. You'll watch a few videos and read about how we put this together and what we hope for you to learn.

Any time we explore a theme in the Bible, it can be easy to lose the thread that you've been following. This is especially true when tracking the Messiah. It's our conviction that the Bible is fundamentally Messianic. From beginning to end it's telling a Messiah story.

From page 3 of the Bible, we're set up with clues as to what this Messiah will look like, what type of vocations he will take up. But as the story goes on, the vision of the Messiah becomes infinitely more complex, filled with seeming contradictions.

So together, we'll use this reader to track six of those vocations together.

## The Bible is Ancient Jewish Meditation Literature

Remember Bible isn't like a pulp novel, a textbook, or a secret magical tome. It's literature designed for a lifetime of reading and exploration and encounter. Check out this video from BibleProject on just what it means for the Bible to be meditation literature.

## Progress

As you go you'll receive **progress** markers.

Progress markers indicate that you've read a chapter of the reader (which might work out to several chapters of the Bible). Some pages have videos, some have a short explainer essay, and most have the words of Scripture (it is a Bible reader, after all).

Remember, the goal isn't just to collect progress markers, but to actively read the Bible as a unified story that leads to Jesus in an unhurried and thoughtful way.

We hope that this will help you on the journey.
