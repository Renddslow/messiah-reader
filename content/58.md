In Greek, the word for Lord is κύριος (kurios), which was commonly used as a title for rulers and emperors, including Caesar.

However, the early Christians boldly proclaimed that Jesus, not Caesar, was the true Lord of the world. They recognized that Jesus' authority surpassed that of any earthly ruler, and they refused to offer worship or allegiance to anyone else. This was a radical and risky stance to take, as it put them at odds with the powerful Roman Empire.

But the early Christians held fast to the belief that Jesus was not just a good teacher or a moral leader, but the very Son of God who had been given all authority and power. They saw Jesus as the fulfillment of the Messianic prophecies of the Hebrew Bible, including Psalm 110, and believed that he had established a new kingdom that was greater than any earthly empire.

So, when they proclaimed "Jesus is Lord," they were not just making a religious statement - they were making a political statement as well. They were saying that Jesus, not Caesar, was the true ruler of not just the world, but the cosmos.
